Please contact support. | An error occurred during computation. This could be <br>caused by an applicative error and it is probably required <br>to open an issue.\n**FDR-1000** | *BAD_REQUEST* | Bad request. | A generic 'Bad Request' error is occurred during request <br>validation.\n**FDR-1001** | *BAD_REQUEST_INPUT_JSON* | Bad request. Field [%] is equals to [%] but this is <br>not a valid value. | A generic error occurred during execution of request <br>syntactic validation\n**FDR-1002** | *BAD_REQUEST_INPUT_JSON_INSTANT* | Bad request. Field [%] is equals to [%] but it is expected <br>to be in ISO-8601 format [yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ] (example: <br>[2025-01-01T12:00:00.123000Z]). | An error occurred during execution of request syntactic <br>validation, in particular regarding the analysis of <br>date values\n**FDR-1003** | *BAD_REQUEST_INPUT_JSON_ENUM* | Bad request. Field [%] is equals to [%] but it is expected <br>to be one of the following values: [%]. | An error occurred during execution of request syntactic <br>validation, in particular regarding the analysis of <br>enumerative values\n**FDR-1004** | *BAD_REQUEST_INPUT_JSON_DESERIALIZE_<br>ERROR* | Bad request. Field [%] generate a deserialization error. <br>Please, set the correct value. | An error occurred during execution of deserialization <br>of request from a JSON string\n**FDR-1005** | *BAD_REQUEST_INPUT_JSON_NON_VALID_<br>FORMAT* | Bad request. The format of JSON request is not valid. | An error occurred during execution of analysis of JSON <br>request, in particular regarding its format\n**FDR-2000** | *PSP_UNKNOWN* | PSP with ID [%] is invalid or unknown. | An error occurred regarding the passed PSP identifier. <br>That PSP is not valid and maybe it does not exists <br>in current environment\n**FDR-2001** | *PSP_NOT_ENABLED* | PSP with ID [%] is not enabled. | An error occurred regarding the passed PSP identifier. <br>That PSP is not enabled and cannot be used for elaboration\n**FDR-2002** | *BROKER_UNKNOWN* | PSP Broker with ID [%] is invalid or unknown. | An error occurred regarding the passed PSP Broker identifier. <br>That PSP Broker is not valid and maybe it does not <br>exists in current environment\n**FDR-2003** | *BROKER_NOT_ENABLED* | PSP Broker with ID [%] is not enabled. | An error occurred regarding the passed PSP Broker identifier. <br>That PSP Broker is not enabled and cannot be used for <br>elaboration\n**FDR-2004** | *CHANNEL_UNKNOWN* | Channel with ID [%] is invalid or unknown. | An error occurred regarding the passed Channel identifier. <br>That Channel is not valid and maybe it does not exists <br>in current environment\n**FDR-2005** | *CHANNEL_NOT_ENABLED* | Channel with ID [%] is not enabled. | An error occurred regarding the passed Channel identifier. <br>That Channel is not enabled and cannot be used for <br>elaboration\n**FDR-2006** | *CHANNEL_BROKER_WRONG_CONFIG* | Channel with ID [%] is not authorized to be used with <br>PSP Broker with ID [%]. | An error occurred regarding the passed Channel identifier. <br>That Channel is not correctly configured for the passed <br>PSP Broker and cannot be used for elaboration. In order <br>to be used, it is required to be configured by PagoPA <br>operator\n**FDR-2007** | *CHANNEL_PSP_WRONG_CONFIG* | Channel with ID [%] is not authorized to be used with <br>PSP with ID [%]. | An error occurred regarding the passed Channel identifier. <br>That Channel is not correctly configured for the passed <br>PSP and cannot be used for elaboration. In order to <br>be used, it is required to be configured by PagoPA <br>operator\n**FDR-2008** | *EC_UNKNOWN* | Creditor institution with ID [%] is invalid or unknown. | An error occurred regarding the passed Creditor Institution <br>identifier. That Creditor Institution is not valid <br>and maybe it does not exists in current environment\n**FDR-2009** | *EC_NOT_ENABLED* | Creditor institution with ID [%] is not enabled. | An error occurred regarding the passed Creditor Institution <br>identifier. That Creditor Institution is not enabled <br>and cannot be used for elaboration\n**FDR-3001** | *REPORTING_FLOW_NOT_FOUND* | Flow with ID [%] not found. | An error occurred during the search of reporting flow. <br>The needed flow does not exists in current environment\n**FDR-3002** | *REPORTING_FLOW_ALREADY_EXIST* | Flow with ID [%] already exists with [%] status. | An error occurred during the search of reporting flow. <br>The flow being created already exists in CREATED/INSERTED <br>status and cannot be overridden. The existing flow <br>must be deleted in order to create another flow with <br>the same name.\n**FDR-3003** | *REPORTING_FLOW_WRONG_ACTION* | Flow with ID [%] exists with [%] status. | An error occurred during the search of reporting flow. <br>The flow being updated cannot be handled with some <br>kind of action (for example, trying to publish a flow <br>in CREATED status)\n**FDR-3004** | *REPORTING_FLOW_PSP_ID_NOT_MATCH* | Flow with ID [%] have field sender.pspId [%] that does <br>not match with query param [%]. | An error occurred during flow analysis. The value of <br>PSP identifier set on query parameter is not equals <br>to the one defined in the request. So, it is required <br>to update one of them in order to proceed.\n**FDR-3005** | *REPORTING_FLOW_PAYMENT_SAME_INDEX_<br>IN_SAME_REQUEST* | There are one or more identical payment indexes in <br>same request for flow with ID [%]. | An error occurred during flow analysis regarding the <br>included payments.

In particular, there are at least <br>one index that is duplicated in the whole flow and <br>it is required to exclude them in the request in order <br>to proceed.\n**FDR-3007** | *REPORTING_FLOW_PAYMENT_NO_MATCH_<br>INDEX* | Index of payment not match with index loaded on flow <br>with ID [%]. | An error occurred during flow analysis regarding the <br>included payments. In particular, there are at least <br>one index that does not exists in the whole flow it <br>is required to delete them from request in order to <br>proceed.\n**FDR-3008** | *REPORTING_FLOW_NAME_DATE_WRONG_<br>FORMAT* | Flow identifier [%] contains a date that is not compliant. | An error occurred during execution of analysis on flow <br>identifier. In particular, the date included in the <br>identifier is not correctly formatted and it is not <br>compliant with SANP specification\n**FDR-3009** | *REPORTING_FLOW_NAME_PSP_WRONG_FORMAT* | Flow identifier [%] contains a PSP ID that is not compliant. | An error occurred during execution of analysis on flow <br>identifier. In particular, the PSP Identifier included <br>in the flow identifier is not correct and it is not <br>compliant with SANP specification\n**FDR-3010** | *REPORTING_FLOW_NAME_NOT_MATCH* | Field fdr [%] does not match with query param [%]. | An error occurred during flow analysis. The value of <br>flow identifier set on query parameter is not equals <br>to the one defined in the request. So, it is required <br>to update one of them in order to proceed.\n**FDR-4001** | *REPORTING_FLOW_WRONG_TOT_PAYMENT* | On flow with ID [%], [%] payments were defined to be <br>added but [%] were actually added. | An error occurred during flow analysis before publish <br>operation. In particular, the number of total payments <br>added by previous steps are not equals to the quantity <br>pre-defined in flow during creation process.\n**FDR-4002** | *REPORTING_FLOW_WRONG_SUM_PAYMENT* | On flow with ID [%], an amount of [%] euro for all <br>payments were defined to be added but [%] is actually <br>calculated. | An error occurred during flow analysis before publish <br>operation. In particular, the number of total amout <br>for payments added by previous steps are not equals <br>to the quantity pre-defined in flow during creation <br>process.\n",
